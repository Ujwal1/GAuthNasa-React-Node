# GAuthNasa-React-Node

The project includes the following: 

1. Creating a SPA that makes a fetch request data to [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html) and displays a new image.
2. Used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/quick-start/) to persist account credentials and allow users to sign up & login to your application to view what todayâ€™s image is. Use [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) & [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) to handle routes/Server communication.
3. Deployed the application using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
4. Added [Google OAuth](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) as an option to sign in & sign up.
5. Access the application [here](https://g-auth-nasa-react-node-raym.vercel.app/login)/
