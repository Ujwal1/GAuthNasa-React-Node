# GAuthNasa-React-Node

The project includes the following: 

1. Creating a SPA that makes a fetch request data to [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html) and displays a new image.
2. Used MongoDB as DB to persist account credentials and allow users to sign up & login to your application to view what image is. Used ExpressJS & NodeJS to handle routes/Server communication.
3. Deployed the application using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
4. Added Google OAuth as an option to sign in & sign up.
